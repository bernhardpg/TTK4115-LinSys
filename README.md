# TTK4115 – Linear System Theory

Consists of two projects, both resulting in a lab report written in Latex:
1. **Helicopter Lab** – An attempt to implement various control mechanisms on a physical helicopter constrained around one axis.
2. **Boat Lab** – Linear control and filtering og stochastic noise signals of a simulated ship.
